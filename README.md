# ixmaps-scripts

This repo includes only _some_ of the scripts required to keep the IXmaps server chugging along. The remainder of the ixmaps user scripts are in the ixmaps-bin repo.

Note that the gitignore will give you clues as to what you'll need to manually download if you want to set up a copy of the server...
